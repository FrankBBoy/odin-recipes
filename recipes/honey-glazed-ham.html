    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      I came up with the glaze for this ham using ingredients on hand and it's
      the best I've ever tasted. If you have any glaze left over, you can add it
      to the pan drippings with a little flour or cornstarch and make a nice
      sauce to accompany the meat. Use the bone and ham trimmings to make soup
      afterwards.

    <ul>
      <li>1 (10 pound) fully-cooked, bone-in ham</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups packed dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/3 cup pineapple juice</li>
      <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
      <li>1/3 large orange, juiced and zested</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place ham in a roasting
        pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small saucepan, combine brown sugar, pineapple juice, honey orange
        juice, orange zest, Dijon mustard, and ground cloves. Bring to a boil,
        reduce heat, and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake ham in preheated oven uncovered for 2 hours. Remove ham from oven,
        and brush with glaze. Bake for an additional 30 to 45 minutes, brush
        ham with glaze every 10 minutes.
